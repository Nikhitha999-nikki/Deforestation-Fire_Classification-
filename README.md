## Fire_Detection

I am going to take my first step in ML through creating this project with my AICTE internship. This project is about the predicting which type of fire or deforestation is going in the world by using the MODIS satellite Dataset.

I am adding the link in the readme file since my Model - best_fire_detection_model.pkl file is 460.1 MB. Any file larger than 25 MB is not accepted in the Github without LFS.

This project aims to predict and classify fire occurrences related to deforestation using environmental data and machine learning techniques.

## Learning Objectives

* Understand the concept and significance of deforestation fire classification.
* Learn data preprocessing techniques using **NumPy** and **Pandas**.
* Explore and implement machine learning models using **Scikit-learn**.
* Evaluate model performance using metrics like **accuracy** and **confusion matrix**.
* Gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets and ML workflows.

## Tools and Technologies

* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
* **Libraries & Frameworks**:

  * NumPy – numerical computations
  * Pandas – data manipulation and analysis
  * Scikit-learn – machine learning models
* **Visualization**: Matplotlib

## Methodology

1. Collected forest fire dataset with features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall.
2. Cleaned and preprocessed the data using NumPy and Pandas.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Built a classification model using Scikit-learn to classify fire-prone conditions.
5. Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Problem Statement

Forest fires cause severe damage to forests, wildlife, and human settlements. Many areas lack efficient early fire detection and warning systems. Rising global temperatures and human activities increase fire risks. Traditional methods are slow, leading to delayed responses.

## Solution

* Collected and analyzed forest fire data including features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall.
* Preprocessed the dataset using Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.
* Built a machine learning classification model using Scikit-learn to predict fire occurrences.
* Evaluated the model's accuracy and performance using appropriate metrics.

## Results & Conclusion

* Successfully demonstrated how machine learning can predict forest fire risks using environmental data.
* Preprocessing and analyzing key features enabled accurate classification.
* The ML model achieved promising performance based on evaluation metrics.
* Early prediction of fire-prone areas can support timely preventive measures and reduce large-scale damage.
